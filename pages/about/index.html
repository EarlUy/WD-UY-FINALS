                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>The Company was founded by Herbert Hyman (1931 -2014) in September 1963 as a
                        coffee service for offices. His wife Mona (whom he married in 1966) and he
                        honeymooned in sweden where they discovered quality coffee. This sparked the
                        decision to import, roast and sel gourmet coffee in Los Angeles, opening the first Coffee Bean
                        store in 1968 in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. Innovation included selling
                        whole beans and touting their country of origin and allowing customers to observe the beans 
                        being roasted and then to sample varietes before making a purchase Hyman died on April 28, 2014, at the age of 82.
                    </p>
                    <p>By the 1970s, The firm had expanded to 10 stores in southern california and had added
                        exotic teas to the menu. In the summer of 1987 an employee brought a blender to a Westwood store where he mixed together
                        ice, coffee extract and chocolate powder, paving the way for the company's signature ice blended drinks. With the 
                        invention of the Ice Blended, the chain saw a surge in popularity. The drink was a predecessor to the Starbucks Frappuccino
                        In 1911, when it was first planning to expand into Los Angeles, Starbucks tried to purchase the firm, but Hyman turned them
                        down. The opening of starbucks stores in Los Angeles unexpectedly helped Coffee Bean's Business, By driving curious customers
                        in the area.
